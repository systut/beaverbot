# Trajectory Generation
This package contains the algorithm that generates the trajectory for the SDV. The trajectory generation algorithms uses hereby JLAP for straight motions and clothoids for turn motions. The algorithm receives the piecewise linear path generated by A*.  
Furthermore, an A* algorithm is provided that generates a piecewise linear path from a start position to intermediate goals (if wanted) and a goal position. The start and goal of the A* path can be set using rviz but can be also inputed in the program itself.

## How to run
*rosrun trajectory_generation generate_trajectory*  
*rosrun trajectory_generation a_star_node*

## Waypoints can be changed in global trajectory.cpp
